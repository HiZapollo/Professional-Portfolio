# Professional-Porfolio

## Description

This website was created as a portfolio to list any projects or accomplishments I gain in my professional life. The website itself is also somewhat of a project, as it was created as an assignment in a bootcamp course, meant to hone my skills with CSS. During my growth as a web developer, I'll be able to add more stuff to the site, make it look better, and perhaps add functionality if needed.

Since I currently have no projects, there will be placeholders in the Works area. This will change.
